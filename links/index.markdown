I learned to weave from artist Cindy Lowther at the [Torpedo Factory Art Center](http://www.torpedofactory.org/artists/lowther_c.htm) in Alexandria, Virginia.

My local artisans&lsquo; guild is the [Potomac Fiber Arts Guild](http://www.potomaccraftsmenguild.org).

Two fun social networking sites for fiber enthusiasts are [Weavolution](http://www.weavolution.com) and [Ravelry](http://www.ravelry.com).

Fiber with a mission can be seen at [Hyperbolic Crochet Coral Reef](http://www.crochetcoralreef.org) and [Hair Flair for Hope](http://www.hairflairforhope.org).

Fiber artisans of all stripes can be seen each spring at the [Maryland Sheep & Wool Festival](http://www.sheepandwool.org).
