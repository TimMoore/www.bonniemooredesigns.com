<p>Two common threads run through the history of personal adornment across cultures and races, oceans and millennia: the interlacement of materials to create cloth, and the stringing of beads to create embellishments.</p>

<p>The intertwining of threads is a metaphor for the interrelationship of people, creatures, and all aspects of our environment. It binds us all together, each point of intersection adding strength to the resulting fabric. And the fabric that results is the narrative that tells the story of culture, conditions, and personal truths.</p>

<p>In like fashion, humans have strung beads together for millennia, choosing materials as humble as seeds and shells, as sophisticated as precious gemstones and metals, and as varied as unique creations from glass, clay, wood, and manufactured materials.</p>

<p>These notions inspire me and help me feel connected to the greater family of humans as I work to the lovely rhythm of the loom, the clatter of beads, the clink of bobbins, and the click of needles: my personal percussion ensemble.</p>

<p>Come, let me show you what I&rsquo;m making&hellip;</p>
