My interests in intertwinings and human narrative have long been reflected in many aspects of my varied work.

I am a career counselor by trade, and so it is the stories of human yearnings, dreams and obstacles that have informed my work and helped me to guide others to create a success identity for themselves, and then to travel on the path that would take them to the fulfillment of their dreams.

But the course of my life has taken many turns, like a shuttle that passes in one direction, then turns and changes its path through the warp threads that connect each pass and give them continuity and substance. As an adult educator, I have worked with and on behalf of people whose varied lives, cultures, perspectives, and goals have formed a beautiful tapestry reflective of America. In leading my organizations and collaborating with others, I have focused on the narratives of groups and institutions, and the intertwinings that help bring labor and purpose, mission and passion into a harmonious whole.

Now, with the gift of time, I am turning more of my focus and energy to play, immersing myself in color and texture and form that are expressive of landscapes, seascapes, and peoplescapes. My interests in intertwining threads were born decades ago at my mother&rsquo;s knee, and have unfolded gradually over time, still in the process of becoming, seeking direction, and making meaning.
